		<p><p>I’m looking for a remote position on a team where I can continue to grow as an engineering lead as well as help steer the engineering team and product. I consider myself a true full-stack engineer with deep experience in both back-end optimization and building rich front-end clients. I have thirteen years experience of writing web applications with Ruby on Rails. I have deployed and configured all pieces of back-end infrastructure needed to run a scalable server-side application, however I have a strong penchance for keeping it simple. I am a voracious learner and enjoy working with like-minded people.</p></p>
